# Folktables

**Folktables** is a Python package that provides access to datasets derived from the US Census, facilitating the benchmarking of machine learning algorithms. The package includes a suite of pre-defined prediction tasks in domains including income, employment, health, transportation, and housing, and also includes tools for creating new prediction tasks of interest in the US Census data ecosystem. The package also enables systematic studies of the effect of distribution shift, as each prediction task can be instantiated on datasets spanning multiple years and all states within the US.
